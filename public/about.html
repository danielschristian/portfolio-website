                    <p>If you have been perusing my website for a brief time, you might be asking yourself the above question.
                <br><br>In short, I am a web developer that is studying to for a Masters in Public Administration degree. My goal is to
                occupy a role (management or development) that utilizies technology to make citizen lives better. Living in the rural south for my childhood taught me that there is still a great divide between places with broadband internet access and ones that don't.
                <br><br> My goal is to attempt to bridge that gap.
                <br><br> I've been a developer for the better part of 4 years (jeez, has it already been that long?) and I have loved the people I have worked with. I've mostly stayed in the realm of database/reporting development but recently I have shifted to front end development.
                <br><br> Being honest, I'm still figuring out how I want to blend my pull towards technology and politics into one role. Perhaps I will discover that throughout this site and you can join me on the way. Regardless, I hope you have a good time on my site and I encourage you to check out the projects (even this very site) I'm currently working on.
                <br><br>Cheers,
                <br>Daniel C.
